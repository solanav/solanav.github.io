      <h3>P2P RAT SECURITY</h3>
      <p>
          While writting a p2p communication protocol for my last project, I was faced with the problem of discovery
          of peers and their authenticity.<br><br>

          The first security meassure is to sign every client or peer that is deployed to the network. The server
          has a RSA keypair. It uses the private key to sign the IP of the client being installed. The public key of
          the server is also given to the client for verification of the server instructions.<br>
          This seems like a good idea because it prevents a third party to infiltrate the network unless the server
          infects the attackers computer. We also make sure that the instructions from the server are from the server.
          The problem with this solution is that clients can not install other clients themselves.<br><br>

          We could try to fix this by requiring multiple peers to verify the new peer so that the attacker would need
          a lot of computers already inside the network to add another one.<br><br>
